Reader, Understand, love, and share. You may think this refers to my shrink, Romeo & Juliet, and Saint-Martin, but in this instance it just summarises some passions of mine: learning and understanding stuff; marvelling at the world around me – people, nature, music, art in general; and sharing what I find interesting or worth admiring. Social networks or blogs are great sharing tools, but not suitable if you want to share a bit more thinking. So this site has been designed to share good old papers and essays, in suitable formats for computers, phones, and tablets. Its main fuel is the selfish pleasure I take in writing and sharing. And the hope that it will give you, dear Reader, some food for thought, the pleasure that comes with discovery, and also a bit of fun. The price to pay: active reading for more than half a page. ;-) The first section contains papers about some science-related topics I find particularly fascinating. I try to present them in an accessible way – and from a bit of a \"different angle\" as well. It is still in the making with more stuff in the pipeline, but we have to start somewhere: an introductory paper, then a 3-episode series about energy. To get started, click here! Other sections will follow – music, art, society, etc. Just bear with me…​ or, better, contribute! If the temptation of writing teases you, you are most welcome to submit a paper. I will be very happy to publish it. The single publishing criterion is both simple and deliciously arbitrary: that I find the paper well written, interesting, and in the spirit described above! Just email me at my usual address or at pierrestuff20@gmail.com. I hope you will enjoy the trip – I certainly do! Many thanks for your visit. Pierre Combelles Cher Lecteur (ou Lectrice, chacun est libre), Comprendre, aimer et partager. Au jeu des associations, ça fait un peu divan du psy, Roméo et Juliette et manteau de Saint-Martin. Mais en l’occurrence il s’agit juste de trois de mes grands plaisirs: apprendre et surtout comprendre des choses; prendre le temps d’apprécier le monde qui m’entoure – les gens, la nature, la musique; et partager ce qui m’a paru intéressant ou admirable. Les blogs ou les réseaux sociaux sont de beaux outils, mais ils sont prévus pour des formats relativement courts. Destiné à des cogitations un peu plus longues, ce site a donc été conçu pour publier/consulter de bon vieux \"articles\" ou \"essais\", sous une forme lisible sur écrans de toutes tailles. La motivation principale en est mon égoïste plaisir d’écrire et de partager. Mais, ami.e Lecteur.trice, j’espère partager ce plaisir avec toi: le plaisir de réfléchir, de découvrir du nouveau, de s’amuser un peu. Le prix à payer: une lecture active de plus d’une demi-page. ;-) La première section est consacrée à des sujets scientifiques que je trouve \"intéressants et racontables\". J’essaie de les présenter d’une manière accessible, mais aussi sous un angle un peu \"différent\". Ce n’est qu’un début et il y a trop de sujets en attente, mais il faut bien commencer quelque part – en l’occurrence avec un prologue et une série de trois \"épisodes\" sur l’énergie. Pour commencer, clique ici! D’autres sections suivront – musique, arts, société etc., mais je dois te demander d’être patient.e… ou mieux, de contribuer! Si l’écriture te titille, en français ou en anglais, n’hésite pas à proposer un papier, je serai ravi de le publier.

Do you know Albert Kahn? If not, look him up. Done? OK. So… A few years back, I visited an Albert Kahn exhibition. I noticed some interesting labels describing the \"autochrome\", a technique invented by the Lumière brothers as early as 1903, to deliver coloured pictures – and pretty good ones. I had to picture (!) the system in my mind to understand how it works. I found it beautifully simple, and made a mental note to write a brief paper about it. But describing a mental picture is not that easy… Plus, there is a bit of a prerequisite. Let’s start with that: what is colour? You may remember from Energy – Episode 1 that it’s about photons' frequencies. In fact, natural light is made of photons whose frequencies span over the whole visible spectrum. Their combination is perceived by our eyes as colourless, or \"white\". When light hits an opaque object, it gets reflected in all directions, with some photons being absorbed. And most objects absorb certain frequencies more than others – this depends on the energy levels of the electrons in the surface material of the object. An object’s colour is defined by the way it absorbs or reflects the frequencies of the visible spectrum. Only white or grey objects reflect/absorb all visible frequencies identically. Black objects absorb almost all visible frequencies. Note that translucent/transparent object also have colours. Like opaque objects, they absorb photons selectively depending on their frequencies, but they let non-absorbed photons go through instead of reflecting them. This is what filters do. Now here is a neat property of the way we perceive colours: if you 1) select three filters of well-chosen \"complementary\" colours (i.e., letting through complementary sets of frequencies), then 2) throw beams of white light through them with the right intensities, and finally 3) recombine the three filtered light beams, you can \"almost\" create a light beam of any colour. \"Almost\" means that you don’t necessarily create the exact colour, but that our eyes will not make the difference. We can see an analogy with the way computers \"code\" colours with three \"RGB\" components (Red, Green, Blue). Autochromes use this property in an incredibly smart way, to build colour slides with black-and-white plates and coloured \"micro-filters\" made of… minute flakes of dyed potato starch. The idea is to \"powder\" a sticky glass plate with an equal mix of \"red, green, blue\" flakes of potato starch before adding the \"normal\" black-and-white film that coats the plate. The trick is then to make sure that, when back-lit, the very small area of glass that supports each flake lets the right amount of light through, so that, combined with the light filtered by the neighbouring flakes, it recreates the colour of the picture in this micro-area. And the beauty is that, to achieve that, you have to do… nothing. Just take a black-and-white picture through this potato-starch-powdered plate. Let’s see why. In a properly focussed camera, every light beam that emanates from a point of the subject and goes through the lens converges back to a single spot on the film – or, rather, on the plate, if we think early 20th century. If the pictured object is coloured, the light that \"hits the spot\" contains the mix of frequencies that defines the object’s colour. The problem, back in the 1910s, is that plates cannot detect this mix. They just react to the overall light intensity, which darkens them. Therefore they yield black-and-white negatives. Then \"black-and-white technology\" has smart ways to invert those negatives and turn them into \"positive\" black-and-white plates via appropriate chemical reactions. Now, if the plate is powdered with coloured \"filters\", the amount of light let through by each filter will depend on the colour of the incoming beam – hence of the pictured object. (From this point onwards, you may want to refer to the diagrams below). A red beam will only go through red flakes and be blocked out by blue and green flakes. The glass spots behind the red flakes will be darkened, but those behind the blue/green flakes will not. If the beam’s colour is not \"pure\" red, blue, or green, then each filter will let the red/blue/green component of the beam go through and block the rest. Depending on the intensity of each component (i.e., on the beam’s exact colour and overall intensity), the coating behind the red/green/blue flakes will darken accordingly. After chemically inverting the plate, the coating’s grey shade behind each flake will reflect the intensity of the red/blue/green component we want to render: white for maximal intensity, black if the component is absent. All we have to do is back-light the plate. The flakes being too small for our eyes to distinguish them, we just see the combination of the light beams let through by adjacent flakes, i.e., the original colour! Sooo elegant. Why potato starch? Because starch flakes, if small enough, are good micro-filters: translucent, able to absorb dye, they can be ground to very small sizes – around 10-20\\$\\mu\\$m. Sounds simple? Well, in practice, obtaining the right product is not that easy. You need to bleach the starch. You want homogeneous flake sizes. Add most importantly, you need a perfectly homogeneous mix of red/blue/green flakes: as you cannot sort them one by one on the glass, you have to rely on statistics to ensure that they are mixed together without any monochrome clusters that would unbalance the resulting colours. Also, the borders between flakes are not seamless – white light may go through and drown colours in a grey halo. The solution to this problem consists in filling the \"gaps\" with super-thin coal powder (1\\$\\mu\\$m grains)… without covering or spoiling the flakes. Overall, although the principle sounds beautifully simple, its implementation requires quite a bit of know-how and industrial equipment. Reed, green, blue, really? Not quite. In practice, autochrome used orange, green, and purple flakes. But it’s fine, as long as those colours complement each other well. Colour rendition… The random distribution of red/blue/green flakes and the imperfect transparency of the \"filters\" create a characteristic patina, which I personally like a lot. A bit like old walls or paintings… Not so flashy, but quite charming and natural. You can find some samples here. Any snags? Yes. Several. First, autochrome makes very inefficient use of light intensity. Several reasons to this: starch flakes are more opaque than glass, meaning that even the frequencies they let through are significantly attenuated. Moreover, each red/green/blue component of the incoming light only hits a third of the plate’s surface – less than that, accounting for the surface covered with coal powder. As a result, even outdoor pictures require 10s exposure! Not very practical, although it can yield fun results: if someone stands still then moves away during exposure time, this person will be visible on the picture, but superimposed to the piece of landscape they uncovered when moving away. Note that while moving, the person will be invisible on the picture – they do not stay still long enough to print anything. Second snag: producing autochrome plates was quite expensive. We have seen that starch homogeneity was not a given; in addition, applying the various layers of material on the plate was very delicate. Third snag, making it worse: you cannot reproduce autochromes because you cannot separate the plates from the starch flakes, nor reproduce the distribution of red/green/blue flakes. Because of these practical shortcomings, although autochrome was \"ahead of the market\" and yielded beautiful colours, it was supplanted by an American technology you might have heard of: Technicolor…","title":"Autochromes: The Tale of the Potato Starch","component":"pierre_stuff","version":"1.0","name":"autochromes","url":"/pierre_stuff/1.0/science/autochromes.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction: a bit of background about colours","id":"introduction-a-bit-of-background-about-colours"},{"text":"How it works","id":"how-it-works"},{"text":"Principle","id":"principle"},{"text":"Implementation","id":"implementation"},{"text":"More facts about the autochrome technique","id":"more-facts-about-the-autochrome-technique"}]},"/pierre_stuff/1.0/science/energy1.html":{"text":"Click here for downloadable PDF version. In the prologue to this series, we established a basic fact about science: science builds models of reality, explaining how the world works around us. So what scientists do is observe and then distill their observations into a model. Then they test and refine. The end result is a collection of rules that enable us to predict what will happen in situations described by those rules. The reliability of such rules is something that engineers gladly take advantage of when designing systems that leverage the very phenomena that scientists' models describe. Now, over time, some rules emerge as \"fundamental laws\" of science. They turn out to be valid for all the models ever built so far. We mentioned two such laws, one of them is about the conservation of energy (something this paper discusses in detail), and the other one is about the relationship between an object’s movement and the force you apply to it. Let’s briefly recall what this latter one is about. Well, it’s more than one law actually, and we have Newton to thank for all of them: We pushed trolleys in the supermarket, trying to accelerate them, or change the direction of their movement. We have found it is much easier to make an empty trolley react than a fully loaded one. And so we have come to the conclusion that the force affecting an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by the acceleration of the object. We also recalled the proverbial story about the apple falling from a tree and hitting Newton’s head, making him wonder about the force dragging the apple to the ground. Yes, this is gravity, the force that Earth exerts on any massive object. Then we combined our knowledge of trolleys and apples and discussed the forces present when two objects interact with each other, like us pushing the trolley and the Earth attracting the apple to the ground. Actually, both objects involved in an interaction will exert some force on the other. In the case of gravity, this force is defined by the mass of the objects, their distance, and something called the \"universal gravitational constant\". Let’s be clear from the start. Energy is the most brilliant concept ever worked out by scientists. Not the most complicated one, but certainly the most fruitful and the most universal. As said before, science (physics and chemistry in particular) is about finding models that work, i.e., repeatedly predict nature’s behaviour. Bear in mind though that these are models that always work under certain conditions only. Energy, however, is present, central even, in absolutely every model in physics, chemistry, and all their branches. I’ll come back to this later. What is so brilliant about the concept of energy? Let’s look at the common meaning of the term: a reasonable definition of \"energy\" is to say that energy is the capacity and will to act. That is not far from the meaning of the ancient Greek term \"energeia\" = activity, operation. And actually, not far from the scientific definition itself. It’s a property attached to an object, quantifiable, which reflects the \"effort\" that has been put into that object. The energy that has been put into it – in a number of possible ways. An obvious way to put energy into an object is to apply a force that accelerates it. It then acquires energy in the form of speed, and intuition tells us that the higher the speed and the more massive the object, the greater the energy. It’s called kinetic energy. You can also heat up the object. Its increased energy is then materialised by its higher temperature – which, interestingly, is due to its molecules [1] moving faster and faster in a random way, so in fact it’s some kind of kinetic energy as well. You can also take your object up a mountain. Then it acquires \"potential energy\" – the higher it is, the higher its potential energy. If you drop it off a cliff, it will be accelerated by gravity – gaining kinetic energy but losing potential energy. It transforms its potential energy into kinetic energy. And this transformation is exactly the concept behind the crazy idea that scientists came up with in the 19th century: the total energy in the universe is constant. Energy only transforms, i.e., takes different forms, all quantifiable with the same measuring units, and the overall quantity is always the same. If you take an isolated system, i.e., a group of objects that do not interact with the rest of the world, the energy within this system remains constant as well (the trick is to properly identify when a system can be considered isolated, as it can have hidden interactions with outside objects). Again, energy can change in form, but it remains constant in total value. I find this quite satisfactory intuitively. Modern physics has found profound mathematical interpretations of energy conservation, but the intuitive interpretation is fine by me: there is no free lunch, and nothing disappears either. Energy just transforms. Another way of putting it is that energy can be stored in many forms – but never lost or created. And arguably most (if not all) of physics and chemistry is about how energy transforms. In the following, we will go through some of the many forms energy can be stored in, and also look at practical situations where it changes form. Some very well-known phenomena can be nicely explained by just asking ourselves: where is the energy going? where is it coming from? how does it transform? Some odd or unexpected phenomena will also present themselves on the way. (If you really don’t like numbers, you can skip this section. The key takeaway to remember is that energy, whatever its form, is measured in joules (J), or smaller units (amounting to a minute fraction of a joule) when calculating with smaller units is more convenient. Also note that power refers to energy delivered per second, and is measured in watts = joules per second.) Before starting our discussion of energy in earnest, a few words about how energy is quantified. You will come across a couple of formulae in this paper, no escaping that. I will not seek to prove these formulae; just remember that they correspond to a model. There is one thing to explain briefly though. If we decided to measure energy with different units, these formulae could be multiplied by, say, 2 or 4 and still be valid. But once a convention has been agreed as to the unit of measurement, the formulae need to be accurate, and their coefficients set so that energy remains constant when it takes different forms. The way energy is modelled is such that, whatever its form, you can always measure it in units corresponding to a mass multiplied by the square of speed (kg x m/s x m/s) [m/s = metres/second]. The corresponding official unit is called the joule (J), and it’s a handy unit to measure \"normal\" (i.e., human-size) energies. When we look at very small particles (and we will!), then J is not a convenient unit: all values would be like 0.00000000000000001J. Therefore, we will be using a much smaller unit called electron-volt (eV) – more about this in the next paper, but for now, all you need to know is that 1 joule = 6 billion billon electron-volts! Closely related to energy is power so let’s talk a little bit about how power is quantified. Power, in physics, is an energy variation per second. For example, the power of a car engine is the amount of energy per second it can deliver. Power is measured in watts (W): 1W = 1J/s. You could equally say that 1J = 1W x s (joule = watt multiplied by seconds); this reflects the fact that energy is obtained by multiplying power (watts) by the duration of power delivery (seconds). In practice, we obviously use J instead of W x s, but in electricity we do use the watt x hour (Wh, pronounced \"watt-hour\") as a unit. 1Wh is the energy delivered by a 1-watt source in one hour, i.e., in 3600 seconds: 1Wh = 3600J. More about electricity later! Now it’s time to start with… Kinetic energy is the energy of an object of certain mass travelling at a particular speed. The way I \"sense\" kinetic energy is: how much effort it takes to bring the object to that speed, or how hard it is to stop it… Therefore, we can expect kinetic energy to grow with both the mass and the speed of the object. In fact, it grows more with speed: it is proportional to the mass (noted as m) of the object, and to the square value of its speed (noted as v2, because you may remember that the trendy name for speed in physics is velocity). The exact formula is: (kinetic) Energy = \\$1/2mv^2\\$ Why \"1/2\"? Well… at least two answers to this – pick yours, they are both valid! Answer 1: Because of the way the joule unit has been calibrated. Answer 2: To make the value consistent with the other forms of energy that kinetic energy can transform into. Now when we talk about \"the effort it takes to bring the object to that speed\", of course we want to relate this to the force we need to apply to this object in order to accelerate it to that speed: we guess that Newton’s famous law, force = mass x acceleration (or f=m\\$\\gamma\\$), is not far. Not far at all… it just takes a different interpretation here, showing how a force injects kinetic energy into an object if it pushes along its movement, working \"positively\" to increase speed, or draws kinetic energy from the object if it resists the movement of the object, working \"negatively\" to decrease speed. I promise the energy-based model gives the same results as Newton’s law… I also promise I won’t take you through the maths that proves it, but we should remember this concept of positive or negative \"work\" of a force: the work of a force is the kinetic energy (positive or negative) it injects into an object. Let’s detail this a bit. Suppose an object is initially at rest (not moving) and then a total force f is applied to it, with f assumed to be constant for the sake of simplicity. As f=m\\$\\gamma\\$ sets the object into motion, the object starts gathering kinetic energy. A bit of maths will tell you that, after covering distance d, the object will have gained a kinetic energy equal to f x d: Ek = work of f = fd If the object is initially moving, then we have two cases: f may \"push along\" the motion of the object, increasing its velocity. In that case, after covering distance d, the object’s kinetic energy will have increased by f x d. The sign ∆ symbolising a variation, we note: ∆Ek = work of f = fd. Inversely, f may resist the object’s movement and slow it down; in which case the object’s kinetic energy will decrease [2] by f x d after the object has covered distance d. If we count f as negative when it resists motion, the formula ∆Ek = work of f = fd remains valid, the negative result accounting for the negative variation of Ek (or, equivalently, the negative work of f). If we look at power P, i.e., the object’s energy variation per second, the above formula naturally becomes: P = fv, v being the object’s velocity. Here you may ask: but what if f is not parallel to direction of the initial motion? Well, from the prologue we know that we can break down f into a component that is perpendicular to an objects’s motion and another component that is parallel to it. The perpendicular component does not modify velocity’s amplitude, which means that it does not impact kinetic energy. Therefore the above simply applies to the parallel component of f. Vectorial calculation would allow us to summarise all of this is as a simple, more general formula, but that would require a bit of mathematical preparation that we may not want here. Next question? Ah yes of course, a very good question indeed: yes, this kinetic energy formula is only valid under certain conditions. It works fine for \"reasonable\" speeds. However, at a very high speed, i.e., when velocity is no longer negligible against the speed of light, things get a bit more complicated… More on this later – hint: in reality, the kinetic energy of an object reaching the speed of light would be infinite, which shows that our formula obviously doesn’t work…​ As mentioned earlier, the temperature of an object reflects the movement of the object’s molecules moving faster and faster in a random way, in all directions (no movement at macroscopic level). The thermal energy of our object is the kinetic energy of its randomly moving molecules. It depends on: the temperature of the object its number of molecules, hence its mass a physical property of the object’s material called \"specific heat\", noted cp Basically, if you want to heat up an object, you need to provide an amount of energy equal to temperature_increase x mass x specific heat – or, reusing ∆ to indicate variation: E = mcp∆T. Makes sense, I think. If the provided energy is supplied by fire, it will actually come from the chemical energy stored in the wood (see below about chemical energy). Then, if the object cools down to its initial temperature, it will shed the exact same energy – this energy typically heating up its environment. Note that water has a pretty high specific heat [3] – we will come back to this later when talking about \"state energy\". I said that the molecules' thermal movement does not create any movement at macroscopic level. However, in some cases, thermal energy can turn into visible \"macroscopic\" kinetic energy. If gas is confined in a finite volume (say air in a tyre’s inner tube), its randomly moving molecules are stopped by the inside of the tube, bouncing on it. This results in a force applying to all the inside surface of the tube, modelled by the concept of pressure – a force per unit of surface. Molecules \"pushing\" the inside of the tube, if you will. If you release the valve of the tyre, then air molecules will find space to move, but only in one direction – through the valve. Air will move in that direction, acquiring \"macroscopic\" kinetic energy. Of course, with the total energy remaining constant, this results in a loss of \"microscopic\" kinetic energy – i.e. of thermal energy. The released air cools down. Put your finger by the valve, it’s really cold there! If we take this a bit further… what if you heat up the confined gas? You can guess what happens, right? Molecules start moving faster, bouncing harder on whatever confines them. Pressure increases. At one point, this may strain the confining object. A dramatic example of this is volcanic eruptions, when the enormous pressure resulting from high temperatures tears the top or the side of the volcano. This results in a massive transformation of thermal energy into \"macro\" kinetic energy, commonly called an explosion. A few more words about pressure. Pressure increases with a rise in temperature, i.e., higher molecule speed, or molecules pushing harder. But it also increases with a rise in molecule density, i.e., more molecules pushing per unit of surface. If you pump air into a tube, pressure inside the tube increases and stretches the tube – the outer surface becomes harder. In fact, a good (and widely used) model consists in using the following formula: P = ρRT. You will guess that P stands for pressure and T for temperature. ρ is gas density (number of molecules per litre), and R is a fixed number called \"ideal gas constant\". In some cases, P suddenly increases with a sharp increase of both ρ and Τ, leading to an explosion. As we go along, we will discuss some useful – and sometimes dreadful – examples. Here you are entitled to complain – or at least to ask a question. If P = ρRT, then P = 0 when T = 0. But there is still pressure inside my tube, right, even at 0°C? And what about negative temperatures? Negative pressure doesn’t make sense… Quite right, and thanks for reading so carefully! In physics, we use a slightly different temperature scale. We measure temperature in \"Kelvin degrees\", or simply \"Kelvins\" (symbol K). The Kelvin and Celsius scales use the same increment, i.e., 1K = 1°C as a temperature difference. However, the \"zero\" of Kelvin’s scale, also called \"absolute zero\", is very different to 0°C. Logically, I think, it corresponds to a state where the object’s molecules are completely still, meaning that their microscopic kinetic energy is zero. And indeed, in that case, the pressure in our tube is zero (and incidentally, the air inside it has turned solid…). Zero Kelvin corresponds to -273°C. Nice and cool. Actually, it doesn’t get cooler than that: a temperature measured in Kelvins cannot be negative. RECAP Ek = \\$1/2mv^2\\$: kinetic energy = 1/2 x mass x square velocity. The energy of a train at full speed… ∆Ek = fd: kinetic energy variation = force x distance (negative if force goes against motion). How force impacts kinetic energy by increasing or decreasing speed via \"f = m\\$\\gamma\\$\" P = fv: power = force x velocity (positive if force goes with velocity, negative if force goes against velocity). Derived from the previous equation by stating that energy variation per sec (i.e., power P) equals f x distance variation per second (i.e., velocity v). E = mcp∆T: energy required to heat up an object = mass x specific heat x temperature variation. Negative if temperature decreases – then the object releases energy. P = pRT: pressure = density x \"ideal gas constant\" x temperature (density reflecting the number of molecules per m3) Radiated energy, or electromagnetic energy, is the energy carried by electromagnetic waves. What’s that? It’s a bit of an abstract concept, I admit. But pretty useful. OK, let’s try. The most famous electromagnetic waves are materialised by light, however visible light is but a small subset of a broader range of electromagnetic waves. Let’s elaborate a bit. Light is modelled by a non-material wave that propagates in the void or through transparent matter such as air. This wave travels fast. I mean, really fast. 300000km/s, referred to as the speed of light, noted as c. At our scale, it goes from one place to another pretty instantly. But not quite. And if you take a very long distance, you start noticing propagation delay. For instance, light coming from the Sun takes about 8 minutes to reach us. Now, like any well-behaved wave, light has a wavelength – the distance between two crests of a wave, in fact between two peaks of an electric field. What’s that again, you may ask? OK… An electric field is the active space that surrounds electrically charged objects or particles. It exerts a force on other charged objects/particles situated within this active space, attracting or repelling them. It is the same type of field that constitutes electromagnetic waves – only it is radiated by a hot source instead of being created by a charged object [4]. Can I go back to my wavelength now? Wavelength is commonly noted as \\$\\lambda\\$. The diagram below provides some visual aid to understanding wavelength: the red curve shows the amplitude of the electric field along the propagation line, and the red arrows show the direction of the force it exerts. Note that it comes with a magnetic field applying its force perpendicularly (blue curve) – hence the term \"electromagnetic\" [5] energy/wave/field. Both curves (hence the wave) propagate along the black \"direction\" arrow at the speed of light. Figure 1. A propagating electromagnetic wave As the wave propagates, the crests travel at speed c – the speed of light. If we stand at a given position as the wave goes by, the field oscillates from being a \"crest\" to being a \"trough\" and back – imagine an anchored boat bobbing up and down as sea waves go past. The period of this oscillation is the time between two passing crests, i.e., the time it takes for the wave to travel one wavelength. So it’s easy: the period is equal to the wavelength divided by the speed of light, or \\$\\lambda\\$/c, expressed in seconds. The frequency of the wave is the number of periods per second, noted \\$\\nu\\$. So \\$\\nu\\$ is simply 1 second divided by the period: \\$\\nu\\$ = 1/(\\$\\lambda\\$/c), or more simply \\$\\nu\\$ = c/\\$\\lambda\\$, expressed in Hertz (=units per second, noted as Hz). The shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency. This \"frequency\" is the one that appears in the common language too when we speak about radio waves – yes, radio waves are electromagnetic waves like light, but at different (much lower) frequencies. Indeed, it is the frequency attached to radio stations – we can now make a bit more sense of it…​ Electromagnetic waves’ frequency also happens to be closely related to their capacity to exchange energy with matter, but this will be for our next paper… Electromagnetic waves' wavelengths (hence frequencies) can take a very wide range of values that lead to very different behaviours. We will see below that completely different phenomena are all electromagnetic waves – just with very different wavelengths. This large span of values will prompt use to use various units of measurement that we will introduce along the way (see also the Reference Annex that closes the Energy Prologue paper). In the case of light, wavelength (or, equivalently, frequency) defines the colour of the light wave. Its longest wavelength (\\$\\lambda\\$ = 700nm [6] is visible as red, its shortest (\\$\\lambda\\$ = 400nm) as violet. In between, a continuum of colours. Now what if an electromagnetic wave is longer than a \"red\" wave or shorter than a \"violet\" one? Well, it’s still an electromagnetic wave propagating at 300000km/s. As wavelength increases beyond red, we can no longer see it, but we can still detect it. Just a bit longer than red (\\$\\lambda\\$~700nm to 100µm [7]), we get \"infrared\". Infrared waves interact with matter in a very interesting way: they easily transfer their energy to matter, heating it up. Think infrared heating. If we increase wavelength further, we reach the range of microwaves (\\$\\lambda\\$~1cm to 1m; a famous example is \\$\\lambda\\$ = 12.5cm, or equivalently f = 2.4GHz [8], for Wi-Fi… and microwave ovens); then radio waves – used to transmit radio and TV (\\$\\lambda\\$~meters to kilometres, e.g. \\$\\lambda\\$~3m or f = 100MHz [9] for FM radio). Now if we go to shorter wavelengths than visible light: beyond violet, we get ultraviolet rays (10nm, responsible for our tan and sunburns), then X-rays (0.1nm, used for radiography), then gamma rays (1pm [10], typically produced by nuclear reactions and pretty dangerous because their very high energy causes odd reactions when they interact with matter). All of these are electromagnetic waves. They have very different behaviours though, which reflects their incredible wavelength range: from kilometres to picometres, or even less for some cosmic rays. To figure out how short a picometre is: the size of an atom is about 100 picometers. And you can string 10 million atoms in 1mm. So, are electromagnetic waves important energy-wise? Well, sort of… Put simply, almost all the energy around us ultimately comes from the Sun, carried by electromagnetic waves – mainly infrared to ultraviolet. These are either reflected to space (keeping their energy) or absorbed by air, the ground, water, plants, plankton – or us sunbathing. It just heats up the air, the ground, and the sunbathers. Water, plankton, and plants are interesting because they don’t just heat up, they also transform energy in more elaborate ways – more on this later. Then, at night, the ground, the air, water, etc., radiate this energy back, mainly as infrared, and consequently cool down: thermal energy re-transforms into radiated energy. Now here come our climate issues: part of the infrared radiated by the ground at night is absorbed by the atmosphere, heating it up instead of leaving the Earth for good. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more infrared is absorbed. This doesn’t apply to other wavelengths, so most of the incoming solar energy gets through, while the nightly outgoing infrared is trapped. Human activity increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere because of our reliance on processes that use combustion. Combustion – burning petrol, coal, wood, anything that contains carbon – produces carbon dioxide. So the Earth is becoming a \"solar energy trap\". It stores more and more energy in the form of thermal energy, and consequently the average temperature increases. Snow and ice melt, which viciously accelerates the process: as the amount of white surface on the Earth decreases, so does the proportion of sunlight that is reflected to space. More sunlight is absorbed – with its energy transformed into thermal energy. By now, even our oceans have started warming up significantly, in spite of their huge mass and very high specific heat. Reversing the process will take centuries… RECAP Light, radio, X-rays are all electromagnetic waves, i.e., oscillating \"electromagnetic fields\" propagating through void at speed c=300000km/s. \\$\\nu\\$ = c/\\$\\lambda\\$ relation between the frequency \\$\\nu\\$, speed c, and wavelength \\$\\lambda\\$ of an electromagnetic wave. Almost every form of energy around us ultimately comes from the Sun via electromagnetic waves. It is stored as thermal energy, but also as chemical energy via plants' and plankton’s photosynthesis – and from there, almost all the sources of energy we know. Potential energy is… a \"potential for energy\" that an object has acquired by reaching a certain state or position. This potential energy can be released by going to another, \"lower energy\" state or position. The released energy doesn’t disappear of course, it just takes another form – many options here. And sure enough, if you want your object to go back to its initial state or position (which, mind, is not always possible), there will be no free lunch: you’ll have to provide it with the exact same amount of energy it released in the first place. Potential energy can take sooo many forms. Some examples follow… Gravitational potential energy is obtained by gaining altitude (note that it takes an effort, the energy has to come from somewhere!). As mentioned above, if the object is then left alone and motionless in the air, it will be accelerated by gravity. Going down, it will lose potential energy but will gather the exact equivalent in the form of kinetic energy. With gravity, potential energy is simply mass x g x altitude, noted Ep = mgh (remember g is the gravitational acceleration). Super handy if you want to calculate the speed (velocity v) gathered by an object after falling off a certain height! When falling, the altitude of the object decreases by the height of its fall. The loss of potential energy is simply mass x g x height (noted ∆Ep = -mgh, negative because potential energy decreases); it’s exactly balanced by the kinetic energy gain ∆Ek = +\\$1/2mv^2\\$, which yields us g x height = 1/2 v2. So the acquired speed (velocity v) is square_root (2 x g x height) – short notation: \\$v=sqrt (2gh)\\$. You can also calculate it from Newton’s law, but it will take you more time and more mathematical tools. As a general rule, energy-based reasoning leads to elegant and simple solutions. And if it doesn’t allow you to make the actual calculation, it gives you a good qualitative idea of \"what’s going on\". Very, very useful before diving into calculations where you can easily forget \"the real thing\" and come up with absurd results just because you made a calculation mistake. And yes, the formula works ;-) … with limitations, of course: Limitation 1: If you look at a very long fall from space, g increases on the way because gravitational attraction becomes stronger as you get closer to Earth. The formula has to be adapted to reflect this (there is a bit of maths here, let’s skip it…). Limitation 2: The formula works well in the void. However, if your object falls through air, as the object’s speed increases, the air begins to resist (wind speed), and the object’s speed no longer increases as fast as our formula suggests. At one point, air resistance will cause the object to reach a maximum \"asymptotic speed\", which depends on its shape and density – an extreme example is the parachute, designed to provide a very low asymptotic speed. \"Limitation 2\" raises a question we should always have in the back of our minds: where is the energy going? The object keeps losing potential energy but no longer acquires the equivalent kinetic energy because the air slows it down. So what is its potential energy transforming into? That’s where friction comes into play. The sudden contact of the fast object with air \"shakes\" the molecules of the object’s surface and those of the air it touches. It sets them in motion, very different from the object’s movement or the air’s turbulences. This motion is actually microscopic random motion we can’t see. Does it ring a bell? Yes: temperature. The air and the object warm up. The object’s potential energy transforms into thermal energy. By the way… in some cases, the object doesn’t just warm up. It bloody heats up. Look at a rocket capsule coming back to Earth, entering the atmosphere at a very high speed… it would burn without its protective tiles! Friction is so strong that the capsule sharply slows down in spite of gravity. So not only the object’s potential energy, but its kinetic energy also transforms into thermal energy. To complete our reasoning, let’s mention that the falling object also causes the air to whirl about (parachutes are very good at that by compressing the air underneath them). Then again, the whirling air’s kinetic energy gradually transforms into heat through air-to-air friction. In countless other situations, we see energy end up as thermal energy through friction. Sometimes this is the desired effect. Vehicles' brakes are a good example – I slow my car down by transforming its kinetic energy into the brakes' thermal energy. (OK, I lied. I just push the pedal.) But sometimes friction is not so desired: friction is why we can’t just set a vehicle in motion and let it continue using its momentum (no force, no acceleration, constant speed). We can’t because friction transforms the vehicle’s kinetic energy into thermal energy, so we have to keep providing external energy to maintain the vehicle’s speed. Several types of friction here, by the way: air resistance, friction of the car’s mechanical parts against each other, some kind of friction between the tyre and the ground as the tyre portion in contact with the ground flattens… I would say that, overall, friction is a bitch, because a) you can’t get rid of it completely unless you are in outer space, which is not a very common situation; and b) thermal energy generated by friction is very difficult to transform back into some useful form of energy… At the end of the day, most of the energy we use ends up heating our environment, often because of friction… It’s a bit frustrating to think that so much sophisticated physical and chemical activity just results in molecules moving about randomly, in total disorder. There would be more to say about this depressing observation, which reveals a very important concept, complementary to energy, called entropy. It measures the degree of randomness, aka the degree of disorder, of a system. I promise I won’t detail how it’s quantified – if I did, there would be no dodging a good deal of maths there. But a key principle of physics, called \"second principle of thermodynamics\", states that the overall entropy of the universe keeps increasing. It can decrease within a given system, but this requires some energy to be fed into this system. And to deliver this energy, somewhere entropy has to increase – and the net result is that entropy remains constant (sometimes) or increases (in most real cases). Some poetical writers summarised this principle in a very short sentence: things fuck up. Quite true. But enough about entropy, this paper is about energy! So, what other forms of potential energy? State energy is the energy associated with a specific physical state of an object – gas, liquid, or solid. The most common example is ice, water, and vapour. Remember I mentioned water had an interesting way of converting the Sun’s energy – not just by heating up? Here we are. It takes a lot of energy to melt ice into water (fusion), and to evaporate water. Much, much more energy than to just heat it up (and yet remember that water has a pretty high specific heat!). Conversely, condensing vapour into water or freezing water into ice sheds a lot of energy that massively heats up the environment. This nicely explains quite a few real-life observations. Let’s see… \"In the desert, days can be very hot while nights are pretty cold\". Why? Because there is no water to evaporate during the day, so all the radiated energy received from the Sun heats up the air and the ground. Inversely, at night there is no vapour to condensate, so thermal energy just converts into infrared that goes away unhampered. And temperature plummets. You can get a 40°C difference between day and night. Very humid climates work the opposite way: temperature hardly varies between day and night. You know why. Another example: \"Dry heat is easier to deal with than damp heat\". Quite true. At a cost though. Let me take a personal example. I cycle for my daily commute. Last summer we had a bit of a heatwave. After work, I cycled back home by 40°C. I first went downhill. What a pain… I was facing a giant hairdryer, my eyes and my face were burning. Then gently uphill. Within minutes, all discomfort disappeared. I actually cycled home very comfortably. What happened? I started sweating. The hot, dry air immediately evaporated the sweat – much faster than damp air, which would already be saturated with vapour. The result was a) a radical cool-down of my skin because the energy of the Sun’s radiation and the 40°C air heat were easily absorbed to evaporate my sweat, and b) my sweat wasn’t dripping – it evaporated immediately. I was dry and cool… Now, I said there was a cost. The process sucked water out of my body very quickly. If I want to cycle for a long time in such massive heat, I’d better drink a lot on the way… a lot! This \"evaporation and cooling\" effect can become quite extreme. Another personal example. Zagora, South Moroccan desert, 50°C, extreme dryness – virtually no vapour in the air. I step out of a swimming pool – I had not thought it useful to take a towel. I dried up in 3 minutes. During these 3 minutes, I got massive goosebumps and my teeth chattered. I was f…​ freezing! So much so that I caught a cold… in air that was 13°C above my body temperature, and with plenty of energy-releasing chemical reactions going on in my body. This is how energy-consuming evaporation is… Inversely, in damp hot weather, the air is already saturated with vapour. My sweat hardly evaporates at all and starts dripping instead. Dripping sweat, no evaporation, no cooling. Not great… And my body is a bit silly here: feeling that my inner temperature tends to rise, it sweats even more – I get drenched, but not any cooler… Ah, before I forget: the energy required to evaporate a certain amount of water is, predictably, proportional to its mass. The multiplication factor is a property of water, called its latent heat of vaporisation, noted Lv. In other words, to vaporise a mass m of water, you need an amount of energy E = mLv, and condensing the same mass of vapour back to liquid water will release the exact same amount of energy. Similarly, melting ice into water requires an amount of energy E = mLf, where Lf is water’s latent heat of fusion. Of course, this does not just apply to water – other bodies also undergo fusion and evaporation, albeit at sometimes very different temperatures. All have their own latent heats of fusion and vaporisation. Interestingly, like water’s specific heat, water’s latent heats are among the highest in nature. RECAP Friction is an \"energy degrader\", turning macroscopic kinetic energy into thermal energy. Ep = mgh: gravitational potential energy gathered by an object of mass m at altitude h. \\$v = sqrt(2gh)\\$: velocity acquired by an object in free fall under gravitational acceleration g (h = falling height), trading potential energy mgh for kinetic energy 1/2mv2. E = mLv: energy required to vaporise a product: its mass x latent heat of vaporisation. E = mLf: energy required to melt a product: its mass x latent heat of fusion. These energies are usually much higher than the energy required to increase the temperature of the same mass by 1°C: latent heats are much higher than specific heats, giving evaporation a key role in climate. We have mentioned that chemical energy comes down to electrons' potential electromagnetic energy. It can usefully be interpreted as the potential energy attached to a chemical state from where a product can undergo energy-releasing chemical reactions – leading to lower chemical energy at the end of the process. If you want the product to go back to its initial state, no miracle: the reverse chemical reaction, if at all possible, will absorb the very same amount of energy that was released by the first reaction… A very common example of an (irreversible) energy-releasing chemical reaction is combustion: it massively turns chemical energy into thermal energy, leaving very little chemical energy to the products of the reaction. In most cases, combustion combines oxygen with organic matter (wood, coal, petrol, gas…) and produces mineral matter (ashes), water, and carbon dioxide – argh, SOS climate! Now here is a more sophisticated example of energy transformation: plants. They absorb part of the sunlight’s energy via a fascinating chemical reaction that takes place in their leaves: photosynthesis, an energy-absorbing reaction that transforms mineral matter and carbon dioxide into organic matter (the matter found in living things, obviously of higher chemical energy). Note that \"plants\" include phytoplankton, huge quantities of photosynthesis-capable micro-organisms drifting near the oceans' surface. By the way… dead organisms are partly recycled into organic matter, but also decay into mineral matter. Photosynthesis is the only way to recreate organic matter, so we badly need that one – it feeds all the living organisms on the planet (and pointedly absorbs carbon dioxide!). Of course, when a living organism dies, the decay process involves energy-releasing chemical reactions whereby matter loses its potential energy and yields thermal energy – just look at a compost heap: it’s pretty warm. But, under certain circumstances, this process also produces \"intermediate\" organic matter that retains significant chemical energy: coal and oil are the most famous examples. Many human inventions consist in smartly using the way all these forms of energy transform into one another. As a first example, let’s look at water boiling in a pot with a lid on. Heat causes water to evaporate faster and faster. In fact, at 100°C, all the water tends to evaporate, increasing vapour density (ρ) and temperature (T). Remember P = ρRT. So P increases quickly and the lid starts dancing on the rim of the pot. What happens there? Pressure lifts the lid, vapour escapes, ρ (hence pressure) decreases, and the lid comes back into place… until more water evaporates and pressure increases again, lifting the lid. In a not-very-efficient way, a bit of the thermal energy is converted to kinetic energy – although most of it goes heating the kitchen. Some smart guys figured out we could do better, and invented steam engines based on exactly the same principle. The lid is a piston and the pot is a cylinder where vapour is injected from a near-boiling tank of water. When the piston is pushed back by vapour pressure, it uncovers holes in the cylinder through which vapour escapes, allowing the piston to come back and hide the holes. Pressure increases again, starting a new cycle. Even smarter is the petrol engine. Here we inject air and a minute spray of petrol into a cylinder and kindle it with a well-timed spark. The sudden combustion releases both heat and gas (ρ and T again!). Gas expands brutally (explosion) and the massive pressure violently pushes the piston back. Exhaust valves are then opened synchronously to let the gas out of the cylinder, allowing the piston to come back to its initial position. Then exhaust valves are closed, more petrol+air is injected, and the next sparkle starts the cycle all over again (see diagram below). More than 1000 times per minute! I am amazed by these inventors’ boldness, figuring out that this could work without the engine exploding into pieces… Figure 2. Power engine – transforming chemical energy into thermal energy, then into mechanical energy Note that this transformation of chemical energy into mechanical (kinetic) energy is not very efficient. Its efficiency is measured as the ratio between the created mechanical energy and the thermal energy released by combustion. Efficiency used to be very poor for car engines 50 years ago at around 15%, but has progressed a lot since, reaching around 35% today. The same efficiency indicator for industrial engines is 50%. Still, there is quite a bit of waste here as the rest of the thermal energy ends up heating the air around the engine… This is frustrating because this thermal energy has been obtained through combustion at the cost of releasing lots of carbon dioxide… Concerns about the climate are giving a new boost to the search for energy efficiency in transport. We have just seen that engines had progressed a lot but still wasted two-thirds of the energy obtained by burning petrol – and releasing carbon dioxide in the process. Worse: we saw earlier that kinetic energy delivered by the engine, materialised by the vehicle’s movement, is entirely wasted when we brake and stop – it all goes into heat via friction (by the way, this is why urban driving uses more petrol). A simple way to avoid this is not to use the brakes and never stop. I won’t bore you with technicalities, but this has a few side effects on security that we probably want to avoid. So here comes an interesting idea: when we slow the car down, could we re-transform its kinetic energy into some kind of potential energy we can reuse later? Yes, we could indeed. We can \"connect\" the car’s wheels to a strong dynamo. The dynamo’s resistance will slow the car down and generate electricity that will recharge a battery. Kinetic energy → electromagnetic energy → chemical energy. Of course, to make full use of this chemical energy, your battery must feed more than the lights and electrical appliances of the car. It must provide at least part of the engine’s power, which means the car must have an electric engine. Hybrid cars combine a power engine and an electric engine: they do not depend on chargers, which is very convenient. But the battery is too weak to power the car for a long time. It is only used for efficiency purposes: to absorb the kinetic energy of the car when braking, and deliver it back when accelerating. In addition, the power engine charges the battery at times when the car does not need much power. Inversely, the electric engine \"helps\" the power engine cope with peak energy requirements, e.g., during acceleration. Therefore, the power engine works more steadily than on a \"normal\" car, which improves its efficiency. This concept works very well in an urban context, much less so on a motorway where the car ends up relying on the power engine only, because there are no opportunities to \"smartly\" recharge the battery. Fully electric cars also reuse the car’s kinetic energy, but it’s not enough to provide all the power they need. In theory it could, if all the kinetic energy of the car was retrieved and if electric engines were 100% efficient. In practice, we are far from this ideal case: electric engines are very efficient but dynamos less so, let alone batteries. And, for obvious security reasons, braking intensity needs to be adjusted with \"traditional\" brakes, which wastes energy into heat. Therefore, electric cars need some external power supply delivered by charging stations. We said that electric engines are very efficient. Indeed, they are – much, much more so than power engines: their efficiency is about 98%! And they don’t shed any carbon dioxide. The perfect option? Well, it all depends on the way the electricity they use has been produced. More on this later! \"Most of our energy ultimately comes from the Sun\"…​ What are the other sources? Geothermal sources: \"central heating\" – volcanos, geysers, hot springs The Earth’s spin: how tides make days longer (I promise, they do!) Rest mass energy: the famous E=mc2! Electromagnetic energy: waves or photons? Nuclear energy versus chemical energy: Goliath versus David Kinetic energy at very high speeds: a bit of relativity Some interesting series of energy transformations A bit of philosophy: we said that science just proposes models, not universal truths. Is energy conservation a universal truth? 1. Molecules are microscopic groups of atoms that constitute the basis of matter around us. More on these later. 2. That is, until the object stops. Then it will start moving in the opposite direction to its initial motion, i.e., in f's direction. f will then start working positively, logically causing kinetic energy to increase. 3. On this note, a familiar energy unit of measurement is calorie (cal). It’s no longer used in physics, but its origin relates to thermal energy… and it’s still used by weight watchers! It is defined as the amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of a gram of water by 1°C. 1cal~4,2J, which tells us that water’s specific heat is about 4200J/°C/kg. 4. More generally in physics, a field is a local property of space, quantifiable, that impacts objects located where the field is active. In this instance, an electric field exerts a force on charged particles or objects. There are many other fields with different actions, e.g.: a magnetic field attracts or repels… er… magnetic objects; a gravitational field attracts massive objects. 5. Electric fields exert forces on charged material, while magnetic fields impact magnetic material (think of magnets). Electric and magnetic are deeply interrelated in the model called electromagnetism theory, which we won’t try to detail here – too maths-riddled! 6. 1nm: one nanometre = a millionth of a millimetre… 7. 1µm: one micrometre, a thousandth of a millimetre, i.e., 1000nm 8. 1GHz: one gigahertz = 1 billion Hz 9. 1MHz : one megahertz = 1 million Hz 10. 1pm: one picometre = one thousandth of a nanometre, i.e., one billionth of a millimetre","title":"Energy – Episode 1","component":"pierre_stuff","version":"1.0","name":"energy1","url":"/pierre_stuff/1.0/science/energy1.html","titles":[{"text":"Previously…","id":"previously"},{"text":"Introduction to energy","id":"introduction-to-energy"},{"text":"How energy is quantified","id":"how-energy-is-quantified"},{"text":"Kinetic energy – or \"energy and force\"","id":"kinetic-energy-or-energy-and-force"},{"text":"Thermal energy","id":"thermal-energy"},{"text":"Temperature and pressure","id":"temperature-and-pressure"},{"text":"Radiated energy or electromagnetic energy","id":"radiated-energy-or-electromagnetic-energy"},{"text":"Potential energy","id":"potential-energy"},{"text":"Gravitational potential energy","id":"gravitational-potential-energy"},{"text":"A word about friction","id":"a-word-about-friction"},{"text":"State energy","id":"state-energy"},{"text":"Chemical energy","id":"chemical"},{"text":"Engines: chemical energy, state energy, thermal energy, and kinetic energy!","id":"engines-chemical-energy-state-energy-thermal-energy-and-kinetic-energy"},{"text":"More about vehicles’ energy efficiency","id":"more-about-vehicles-energy-efficiency"},{"text":"To come…","id":"to-come"}]},"/pierre_stuff/1.0/science/energy2.html":{"text":"Click here for downloadable PDF version.

Dear Reader, I am convinced that science is an incredibly fun domain, but you may wonder if this section is for you. If you are not versed in science, will these papers be enjoyable reading for you? If you are well-versed already, will they tell you anything new? To be honest, I have the same questions myself. I tried a slightly perilous game: being accessible to anyone who remembers the basics of secondary school maths, and \"telling the story\" in a way that brings something new to more advanced readers as well – a different perspective, so to speak. Obviously, this could be a recipe to lose the former AND bore the latter…​ Only one way to find out: read the papers!

Let’s get one thing out of the way: I find the natural sciences fascinating. This paper is opening a series whose ambition is to share this fascination, and perhaps to spark some new interest in this topic. So don’t expect a serious analysis of science vs ethical dilemmas, or the importance of science vs other areas of knowledge – I am way too biased for that. Rather, expect a hopefully pleasant and understandable explanation of some key scientific concepts, through examples that you can easily reuse to impress whomever you need to impress in cocktail conversations. This \"prologue\" will first give a hint of what science is about and how it shapes the world we live in. Then it will go through a few useful concepts that will come in handy when describing the world around us in scientific terms in the next papers of our series…​ Finally, a Reference Appendix will introduce a few useful notations and describe the various units of measurement we will encounter in this series. Some of these measures will be properly introduced in later papers, but it’s good to have them all in one place for future reference. So, about science…​ Here I may have a slightly more political objective: science and scientific reasoning are recurrently questioned by religions that hang on to absolute truths, or simply by people who want to believe or convince that \"their\" truth is stronger than facts. But science does not propose a truth against which to set another truth. It just builds models of reality – a more modest but more verifiable proposition. Let’s elaborate a bit. Science seeks to explain how the world works – not why, just how. You observe what is going on and you try to find a model that describes it, allowing you to predict what will happen in similar situations. This may sound logical and basic to us, but a couple of centuries ago, science represented quite a revolution in a world where knowledge was dominated by religion, which had a completely opposite approach: state a universal truth and judge facts against this pre-defined, unchanging truth. No truth in science, only models that have to tally with facts or else be updated! A famous example of the scientific approach is that applied by Newton, who allegedly observed an apple falling from a tree…​ an apple accelerating towards the ground. How do we model that? Well, we can model that by saying that some force is attracting the apple to the ground. Measure this acceleration for different apples. Then with a bit of maths, predict the movement of the apple (where it should be after falling 0.5, 1, 2 seconds, what happens if you throw it, etc.). Then test the model. Drop or throw various objects. Under certain conditions, you will see it works well. You can repeat your test, objects react as you predicted they would. Every time. As long as they are not too light and/or not too fast, because then the air slows them down (due to friction – we will come back to this in our next paper), and you need to factor this in your model. Then you can safely say: under certain conditions, the model works. You can predict the objects' behaviour and you can take advantage of this knowledge – for example to launch ballistic missiles…​ More on Newton in the next section! Applying a model is (well, relatively) easy. Inferring it from observation is an altogether different challenge. Especially when you address areas that we cannot observe \"naturally\" around us – typically at very large distances and speeds, or on the contrary, for very small particles: in such cases, the behaviour of these objects does not correspond at all to the intuition we have built when observing \"normal size\" objects. So the guys who managed to model their behaviour are just f…​ing geniuses. No model works in all cases, so we keep identifying new conditions beyond which our models need refining. But a model applied under the right conditions works. Every time. You can verify it through experimentation; in fact, any number of independent scientific teams can verify it. So it’s not an absolute truth, it’s only a model that matches what we observe. But you can verify it. And the beauty of it all is that being able to predict how objects will behave thanks to these models, you can build systems that do what you want, leveraging this anticipated behaviour. Lots of very good engineers work on this of course, finding super-smart applications of scientists' models: electricity, chemical industry, dams, bridges, buildings, processors, medical instruments, transportation, phones…​ every man-built object in our lives exists because scientists managed to find the right models. And I repeat: engineers are smart guys and do wonders. But the great scientists, those who are/were able to imagine the core models that describe the world…​ I am not even able to imagine the power of their brains. And they changed our lives more than any businessman or politician. OK, I have made my point, I think…​ One word about the fundamental laws of physics (there will be a lot of physics in this series, because…​ well, if I’m honest, mainly because I like physics)…​ Some rules emerge as \"landmarks\" that remain valid across all the models built so far. The most famous one is that the energy of a system remains constant if the system does not interact with the rest of the world (we’ll see a lot more of this one in future papers of this series). These landmark rules become \"fundamental laws\" and new models make sure they respect them to ensure consistency with other models…​ and increase their chances of being relevant. A model where energy is not constant is very unlikely to resist scrutiny…​ Here you may say: \"but you just said there is no absolute truth in science\". A very interesting point actually, one that merits a discussion of its own. We will come back to this at the end of our series on energy. Now a few words about maths…​ Maths is a bit special. It’s not a natural science. It doesn’t model something we observe, although mathematical intuition does borrow from the tangible reality around us – for example, we visualise number 4 as a collection of 4 \"real\" objects. But other than that, maths lives by itself. In maths, we start from assumptions. Maths is basically about this: \"Let’s assume that these core rules are true…​\", or \"Let’s assume that these objects or these operations between objects have these particular properties…​ What can we infer from that?\" And the game consists in inferring as many derived rules and properties as possible, from as few assumptions as possible (so that the application field is as broad as possible). Can be a bit pedantic at times, but in some cases the power of this approach is really surprising. So you start from these minimal assumptions, this core set of objects, properties, and rules. Then you smartly apply your core rules to specific objects to derive secondary rules (theorems, properties that apply to certain objects, etc.). Then you apply these new rules to the right objects and you enrich your set of rules progressively deducted from one another through logical reasoning. Sometimes you guess that a new rule applies but the trick is to prove it, i.e., to show that it can be deducted from already proven rules and ultimately from the initial assumptions. Until you have proved it, your new rule is only a conjecture. A bit like in physics: you can see it’s a good model, it seems to work for all the examples you can think of. But here a conjecture is not good enough. You need to prove it always applies (as long as the initial assumptions are valid). It’s a big difference when compared with other sciences, which are content with \"it’s consistent with other models, it applies repeatedly to all the cases we have imagined, so I validate it until someone comes up with an edge case that doesn’t work\". Unlike physics, maths demands proof. And proving some conjectures can be horrendously difficult – some resisted for over a century! Maths is a great tool for other sciences because it allows you to say \"if this is true, then this is true too\" – the basis of reasoning. More concretely, maths provides all the calculation tools and abstract objects other sciences need for their models. Indeed, some physicians found they lacked mathematical tools (=adequate sets of objects, properties, and rules) and had to work on maths for a while to build those tools before returning to physics. This can sound a bit abstract but just look at physics' models: they often take the form of mathematical formulae. And believe me: in some cases, physics has led maths into new areas that are quite complicated…​ Now, let’s get started with Newton’s physics. We’ll begin with a fundamental law of physics that defines the relationship between an object’s movement and the force you apply to it. This will lead us to understanding a bit more about gravity. On the way, we will gather a few concepts that will serve us well in our next papers…​ If you want to study physics, pick an empty trolley in a supermarket. When you push it around, you can do whatever you want effortlessly: move, turn, accelerate, slow down, turn, stop. You hardly need to \"force\" the trolley. You push or pull it slightly in the right direction, applying a small force, and it follows. Now load your trolley with bottles of milk. Why milk? Because it’s heavy and healthier than wine. OK, wine will do too. (By the way, what does \"heavy\" mean? More on this later.) What happens when the trolley is full? As long as you walk regularly along a straight aisle (whatever your speed), you see no real difference with the empty trolley. You hardly have to push it along, it follows its momentum. But try to accelerate, and it becomes a different story: you need to push much harder. The heavier the trolley, the harder you need to push to get a reaction. And the harder you push, the more it reacts and accelerates. Why not try a simple model here: the applied force is proportional to the mass of the trolley and to its acceleration. And if you use the right unit, you can even try: force = mass x acceleration. Bingo, it works. It works so damn well that it has become the core principle of Newton’s mechanics, a fundamental law of physics. Note that it’s also difficult to slow the heavy trolley down, or to change its direction. In fact, it’s difficult to change its speed, be it in amplitude or direction. This tallies perfectly with the definition of acceleration in physics: it doesn’t just mean \"go faster\", it means \"speed variation per second\". Speed, also called velocity (v) in physics, is modelled by an amplitude (how fast you go) and a direction (in which direction you are going). So is acceleration. If acceleration is in the same direction as velocity, we get the common meaning of acceleration (go faster); if acceleration is in the opposite direction to velocity, then the object is slowing down. If acceleration is perpendicular to velocity, velocity changes direction but keeps the same amplitude – this, also, is easy to figure out if you imagine how you change the direction of a trolley. If acceleration is in yet another direction (neither parallel nor perpendicular to velocity), then velocity changes both in amplitude and direction. The applied force also has a direction, of course. And the magical formula force = mass x acceleration also applies to the direction, in the sense that acceleration has the same direction as the applied force. A word about units here: Mass is measured in kg. In everyday life, speed is measured in km/h. However, in physics, velocity is rather measured in metres per second (m/s; do the maths: 1m/s = 3.6km/h). Acceleration being a velocity variation per second, it is logically measured in \"metres per second per second\": (m/s)/s, usually noted m/s2. Force’s unit of measurement is called…​ the \"Newton\" of course(!), signified by N. It is calibrated to ensure that force(N) = mass(kg) x acceleration(m/s2) – and not, for example, force = 1.38866328763 x mass x acceleration…​ Another very important point if you want to sound more credible in cocktail conversations…​ In physics jargon, force is symbolised by the letter f, mass by m, acceleration by the Greek letter \\$\\gamma\\$ (gamma). Therefore the casual geek way of evoking this fundamental law is: f = m\\$\\gamma\\$. Just so you know. You will often find a small arrow above f and \\$\\gamma\\$, to show that f and \\$\\gamma\\$ have the same direction: \\$\\vec{f}\\$ = m\\$\\vec{γ}\\$. We will omit it in the rest of this prologue, but it’s there! You may wonder why I am using the word \"mass\" instead of \"weight\". And NO, it’s not because it sounds better in cocktail conversations (although it does). The weight of the trolley refers to how heavy it is, i.e., how hard it is to lift it from the ground. Or if you prefer another image, how hard it presses against the ground. But soon, with guys like Elon Musk, you will have a chance to go to outer space for a holiday. There your trolley will be floating, perfectly weightless. Weightless, but not without mass. Try pushing it to accelerate it or change its direction, you will have to apply exactly the same force as in your supermarket, and f = m\\$\\gamma\\$ will still work perfectly (believe me, it’s been verified via experiments many times). So the mass of your trolley is still there, not its weight. Mass is a property of the trolley (measured in kg), while weight is the force that applies to the trolley when attracted by the Earth (measured in N, although we use kg in common language because we see mass and weight as equivalent when on the ground). Big difference, right? Which leads us to apples…​ Newton was having a nap under an apple tree. An apple fell and hit his face, waking him up rather abruptly. (This is not science, it has not been verified!). Rather than cursing, Newton wondered: \"this apple accelerated pretty fast to hit me with that speed…​ and f = m\\$\\gamma\\$, so…​ what force is dragging it to the ground?\" Wherever we are on the planet, this force always points at the ground. A reasonable assumption is that the Earth attracts the apple. Indeed, this is the real meaning of weight: the attraction force the Earth exerts on any massive object. The cocktail name of this attraction is gravity. Then we observe that apples and other objects, with certain limits related to air resistance, all accelerate the same way when dropped – regardless of their mass. This common acceleration, constant throughout the fall, is called \"gravitational acceleration\", signified by the symbol g. But f = m\\$\\gamma\\$…​ so if you take a bigger apple, it takes a bigger force to obtain the same acceleration, right? The Earth’s attraction force must be proportional to the apple’s mass. And of course it is, basic intuition tells us so. weight = m\\$\\gamma\\$ = mg, whatever the value of m is. g being constant across the surface of the Earth and varying very slowly with altitude, no wonder we happily confuse weight and mass! Now it can all become a lot more interesting…​ when you push your trolley, you will feel it resists…​ it pushes your hands back, so you need to lean forward to keep your balance. If you study the consequences of f = m\\$\\gamma\\$ in detail, you will find that the reaction of the trolley onto your hands is a force exactly opposite to the force you apply to the trolley. Similarly, you will find that if the Earth attracts the apple, the apple also attracts the Earth by the same force…​ Of course, given the huge mass of the Earth, the Earth does not accelerate much towards the apple! Now look at the symmetry here. Would it make sense to assume that the force the apple and the Earth apply to each other (call it weight) is proportional to the mass of the apple AND to the mass of the Earth? Weight = mass apple x mass Earth x \"a thingie\". Then f = m\\$\\gamma\\$ tells us two things: applied to the apple: weight = mass apple x acceler.apple implies that the acceleration of the apple (g) equals mass Earth x \"a thingie\" applied to the Earth: weight = mass Earth x acceler.Earth implies that the acceleration of the Earth is mass apple x \"a thingie\" = g x mass apple / mass Earth (we see very well that it’s negligible compared to the acceleration of the apple! In practical terms, the Earth, of course, doesn’t move towards the apple). Next question, even more interesting: what is this \"thingie\"? When in outer space, the apple floats. It doesn’t accelerate towards the Earth. So where is g gone? A reasonable assumption is to say that gravitational force decreases with distance from the Earth. A bit of experience will prompt you to assume that it decreases proportionally to the square of the distance from the centre of the Earth. So: weight = mass apple x mass Earth x \"something\" / square distance. Or if you prefer, g = mass Earth x \"something\" / square distance, g now depending on the distance from the centre of the Earth…​ And if we are right, \"something\" remains constant. And lo and behold, it does. We call it G, universal gravitational constant. Now we can forget the Earth and the apple. Because if we are right, we can be a lot more general: 2 objects of respective masses m1 and m2, their respective centres at distance r, attract each other with a force equal to m1 x m2 x G / r2, G being a universal constant. At our usual scale, G is very small so you need at least m1 or m2 to be very large for the force to be detectable (or r has to be very-very small, but it can’t, as it has to be larger than the sizes of the objects!). So, does it work? You bet it does! Of course, there are a few limitations, as in any model: when distances and speeds get very large, then something starts going wrong. Relativity will be needed in that case. Much, much more complicated to explain (we’ll try in a future paper!), let alone to figure out…​ And when r becomes very small (in the case of atoms, for example), the model becomes dodgy as well – and interactions other than gravity step in. Quantum mechanics will sort this out at the cost of horrendous mathematical complications…​ But at \"our normal scale\", Newton’s model just works perfectly – so much so that mechanics, the area of physics that studies the motion of macroscopic objects, is often referred to as \"Newton’s mechanics\" as opposed to \"relativist mechanics\" (for very high speeds) and \"quantum mechanics\" (for very small scales). More fun: look at a satellite. It goes very fast (Newton’s model still works very well at these speeds though), and its weight draws it towards the Earth. So it turns towards the Earth, but it’s so fast that it falls \"beyond the Earth\" and its weight remains perpendicular to its velocity – so the amplitude of its velocity doesn’t change. It keeps rotating round the Earth. Same for the moon. Same for the Earth around the Sun. From there, it’s just maths to figure out distances between planets, their mass, etc. And also to predict tides, to design ballistic missiles, and so many other fun things. Just because we have a good model. Isn’t that amazing? In our next paper, we’ll start a series about another fundamental concept we have not touched upon yet: energy! Very original, powerful, and simple to use, this concept (and the related \"landmark\" law) has countless interesting (and sometimes unexpected) applications around us…​ Question 1: In the supermarket, the trolley stands still or moves horizontally. It obviously has no vertical acceleration, so the vertical force on the trolley should be zero. But what about its weight ─ it surely is still there, dragging it down? Yes, of course. But in f = m\\$\\gamma\\$, f is the sum of all applied forces, in all directions. Vertically, the total force applying to the trolley has to be zero. And it is, because the ground reacts to the trolley’s weight by applying the exact same force to the trolley ─ but upwards. Actually this force from the ground applies to us too, reacting to our own weight. We are hardly aware of it because our legs and feet are so used to it…​ but take your shoes off and stand on gravel…​ Question 2: OK, but if I pull my trolley up, nothing happens (unless I pull really hard)? Indeed. Your upward force remains smaller than the weight of the trolley. Therefore your effort + the weight still amount to a downward force, compensated by the ground’s reaction. All that happens is that the ground’s reaction is now smaller ─ you \"lighten\" the trolley. Question 3: OK, but here we are talking about conveniently aligned forces ─ both vertical. How do you add up forces that point to different directions? Well, that’s a good question. An example of how maths helps us with their habit of looking for rules that apply as broadly as possible. You can add up objects that are a bit more generic than numbers ─ called vectors. Vectors can conveniently represent force, or velocity, or acceleration. Anything with a value and a direction. Now push your trolley in any direction, also pushing it slightly upwards. You can say the force you are applying is part vertical, part horizontal. And the horizontal bit is part along the aisle, part perpendicular to the aisle. Actually each of these three components (parallel to aisle, perpendicular to aisle, vertical) can be quantified. Now your force f is represented by 3 numbers. Call that a 3-dimension vector at cocktail parties (a vector is any group of n numbers). The 2 horizontal directions and the vertical direction are traditionally referred to as x, y, z, therefore the 3 components of f are typically noted (fx, fy, fz). And remember the arrow on top of f to mention it has a direction ─ it actually says that f is modelled as a vector \\$\\vec{f}\\$ = (fx, fy, fz). We can visualise this with an arrow representing \\$\\vec{f}\\$ in the supermarket: Figure 1. Forces applying to your trolley Do this for every force applying to the trolley: The force you apply is: \\$\\vec{f}\\$ = (fx, fy, fz). As per your previous question, fz is positive (upward) but we assume it’s too small to lift the trolley. The weight of the trolley, call it \\$\\vec{w}\\$, is vertical: it only has a \"z\" component, negative because it points downward, equal to the full weight w of the trolley: \\$\\vec{w}\\$ = (0,0,-w) The ground’s reaction, call it , is also vertical, pointing upward (positive): \\$\\vec{r}\\$ = (0,0,r) (to be accurate: if the load of the trolley is balanced, r/4 applies to each wheel!) Now we can answer your question and calculate the total force applying to the trolley, simply by adding up the components of all identified forces along each direction. The three sums are the three components of the total force: \\$\\vec{f}\\$total = (fx, fy, fz + r-w). We can even go a bit further: if we know the weight of the trolley and the force you are applying, we can calculate the acceleration of the trolley and the reaction of the ground (r): Let’s play the same \"vector game\" with acceleration γ – or, should I write: \\$\\vec{γ}\\$ = (\\$\\gamma\\$x, \\$\\gamma\\$y, 0). The third component is zero because acceleration is horizontal. Multiplying \\$\\vec{γ}\\$ by m comes down to multiplying its three components by m: m\\$\\vec{γ}\\$ = (m\\$\\gamma\\$x, m\\$\\gamma\\$y, 0). Then our magical formula says \\$\\vec{f}\\$total = m\\$\\vec{γ}\\$ from which we infer: fx = m\\$\\gamma\\$x, hence \\$\\gamma\\$x = fx/m fy = m\\$\\gamma\\$y, hence \\$\\gamma\\$y = fy/m fz+r-w = 0, hence r = w-fz The fact that r is smaller than w materialises the fact that you \"lighten\" the trolley by pushing slightly upward. More generally, in mechanics, calculating the trajectory of an object involves the following items: The position of our object, also modelled as a vector, say \\$\\vec{pos}\\$. Its components are often noted a bit specifically: \\$\\vec{pos}\\$ = (x, y, z) instead of (posx, posy, posz). This position changes with time t, therefore we note it: \\$\\vec{pos}\\$(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) The velocity of our object. It also changes with time, therefore we note it \\$\\vec{v}\\$(t) = (vx(t), vy(t), vz(t)). We can say that \\$\\vec{v}\\$(t) represents the variation of \\$\\vec{pos}\\$(t). The acceleration of our object, \\$\\vec{γ}\\$(t). Similarly, \\$\\vec{γ}\\$(t) represents the variation of \\$\\vec{v}\\$(t). And of course the sum of the forces that apply to your object, \\$\\vec{f}\\$total(t). In many instances, \\$\\vec{f}\\$total(t) can be expressed as a function of \\$\\vec{pos}\\$(t) [1] and/or \\$\\vec{v}\\$(t) [2]. As a consequence, the relation \\$\\vec{f}\\$total(t) = m\\$\\vec{γ}\\$(t) can be transformed into an equation that binds \\$\\vec{pos}\\$(t), \\$\\vec{v}\\$(t), and \\$\\vec{γ}\\$(t). In other words, a relation between \\$\\vec{pos}\\$(t), its variation and the variation of its variation! Maths will rescue us here…​ Such equations are called differential equations, and have been studied extensively. They allow us to calculate \\$\\vec{pos}\\$(t) as a function of time only, i.e. to predict the object’s trajectory. To be honest, most differential equations can’t be solved into clean formulae. Instead, \\$\\vec{pos}\\$(t) has to be calculated step by step by a computer, following small time increments. But in some very useful cases, we can find a nice formula describing \\$\\vec{pos}\\$(t), a famous example being the movement of satellites around planets, or planets around stars. Physical quantities like distance, velocity, mass, force, energy, etc. are expressed as an amount of measurement units – e.g. a distance of 10 meters. The scale of a physical quantity can vary considerably depending on the context, requiring different units of measurement for obvious practical reasons: measuring distances between particles and distances between stars in the same unit would involve pretty unwieldy numbers…​ Another way to navigate more easily between very different orders of magnitude consists in using powers of 10 to express large values: 103 instead of 1000, 106 instead of 1000000, etc. (as a reminder, the superscript indicates the number of zeros). When you reach values like 1030 (it happens!), you start liking those mathematical notations…​ The same is true for very small values: we’ll use negative powers of 10. 10-1 = 0.1, 10-3 = 0.001, 10-6 = 0.000001. Note that for a given number n, 10-n equals 1/10n. More generally, for two given numbers n and p (positive or negative), 10n x 10p = 10n+p. Hence the convention 100 = 1. Important for cocktail conversations: 10n is pronounced \"10 to the nth power\", or better \"10 to the nth\" (the latter sounds more casual, implying that you handle powers of 10 on a daily basis). Similarly, 10-n is pronounced \"10 to the minus n\". Also, physical models involve relationships between different physical quantities, hence relationships between the corresponding units of measurement. We have already seen some simple examples: velocity, corresponding to a distance divided by a time duration (meters divided by seconds), is measured in meters per second and noted m/s. Similarly, acceleration is velocity variation (m/s) divided by time duration (s); it is therefore measured in (m/s)/s, or m/(s x s) – more conveniently written as m/s2. Force, being mass multiplied by acceleration, could be expressed in kg x m/s2 (or the alternative notation kg.m/s2). However, using N (Newtons) is obviously more compact, and more meaningful. The table below summarises the main units and sub-units of measurement we will come across in this series, as well as the relationships between them. Many of them will be introduced later – this table is just meant to serve as a reference if you are interested, so don’t read it now, but feel free to keep coming back here as you are progressing with the series!

For example, gravity: the gravitational force applying to an object attracted by the Earth (i.e. its weight) depends on the position of the object relative to the Earth. It points from the object towards the centre of the Earth, and we remember that its magnitude depends on the square distance from the object to the centre of the Earth. 2. For example, air friction: the \"resisting force\" applying to a moving object depends on the velocity of this object relative to the air.","title":"Prologue","component":"pierre_stuff","version":"1.0","name":"prologue","url":"/pierre_stuff/1.0/science/prologue.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","id":"introduction"},{"text":"Science","id":"science"},{"text":"Illustrating a model: force, mass, acceleration, and supermarkets","id":"illustrating-a-model-force-mass-acceleration-and-supermarkets"},{"text":"Apples and gravity","id":"apples-and-gravity"},{"text":"Questions you may ask…​ if you want to go further","id":"questions-you-may-ask-if-you-want-to-go-further"},{"text":"Reference Appendix: Notations and Measures","id":"ref-appendix"},{"text":"Distance","id":"distance"},{"text":"Time","id":"time"},{"text":"Speed and acceleration","id":"speed-and-acceleration"},{"text":"Mass","id":"mass"},{"text":"Electricity","id":"electricity"},{"text":"Energy and power","id":"energy"}]},"/pierre_stuff/1.0/science/relativity.html":{"text":"Coming soon…​","title":"Sensing Relativity","component":"pierre_stuff","version":"1.0","name":"relativity","url":"/pierre_stuff/1.0/science/relativity.html","titles":[]}}})

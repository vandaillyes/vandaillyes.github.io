This paper about Brassens, Brel, and Barbara represents a personal view, not a factual description, nor a systematic analysis.
Having grown up under their influence, I made the assumption that my own reaction to their work could exemplify their influence over French culture. This assumption is less valid for Barbara because I actually discovered her much later in my life. But Brel and Brassens really shaped my mind.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allegedly, the three "Giants" of the French chanson are Georges Brassens, Jacques Brel, and Leo Ferré ─ because they were able to convey three major streams of the emerging post-war French values (and to some extent European values).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Brassens impersonates intelligence, simplicity, friendship, irony, generous individualism, respect for "small people", humorous challenge of the establishment, and social "good morality". He is also considered as the ultimate wordsmith when it comes to lyrics. I agree with this judgement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Brel is also an individualist who celebrated friendship, but his domain is passion. Live life to the hilt, in good or bad ─ boredom is worse than pain or death. Celebrate even what&#8217;s ugly as long as it&#8217;s intense. Put your guts on the table. Another strong aspiration of post-war society. He has all the qualities to impersonate his stream: irresistibly powerful writing, music to match, and mesmerising stage presence. From my perspective, the greatest ever if you look at the whole package.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ferré is the revolutionary guy – the communist of the gang. Also quite intense, he could address universal questions such as age or death, but he was much more on the political side.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t fully agree with this list. I would take Ferré out because his "stream" proved less durable than the other two&#8217;s. And also because I find his writing a bit conceited and not nearly as good as Brel&#8217;s or Brassens'. Obviously, this is purely a personal opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, and this is quite recent, I would add one person to this list. Barbara. She embodies a much more relevant stream than Ferré&#8217;s: the emergence of a free woman, intelligent and sensitive, determined to live life to the full in spite of the social pressure women are still facing. She gets wounded in the process but she moves forward nevertheless. Her songs are all about this – and all refer to specific episodes of her life. Her writing is fluid, marvellously woven into the (beautiful) music. Her stories are moving yet full of energy – like her. Only I don&#8217;t like the way she sings. For this reason, I ignored her songs for a long time – until a brilliant young singer decided to cover them. And I discovered what I had missed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could say that each of these four singer-songwriters represented a will to pull free from the grip of the "old" society as France transitioned to the post-1968 era. Brassens challenged the stupidity of the system, its lack of empathy for individuals, its undue constraints on people&#8217;s freedom. Brel loathed it because it was dead and desireless, and worse, because it tried to <em>suppress</em> desire. Barbara just challenged it by being a free woman regardless of conventions. And Ferré preached the revolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have a bit of an extreme view on B, B, and B. They killed the French chanson. They castrated the next generations. They were just too good. You can find gems from more recent singers that reach their levels but not consistently. A number of later singer-songwriters said "these guys are inspiring but we know we&#8217;ll never be nearly as good as them". The bright side is that it forced the next generations to find new pastures, which arguably is preferable to trying to improve an existing recipe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before closing this introduction, a word about Edith Piaf. One may be surprised not to see her in the list. But she clearly isn&#8217;t. She was an incredible interpreter and an amazing woman. Before Barbara, she challenged the system by living a free woman&#8217;s life. But this is not reflected in her songs – because she did not write them. As a matter of fact, her songs largely belong to the "old" repertoire. The 3Bs, on the contrary, did it all: writing, composing, singing. They controlled the whole channel from their minds to ours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following, I will go through samples of their work, trying to explain why I love it so much. My ambition is to share this love with you, reader. I assume you can read English and have had some exposure to the French language. Note that French readers able to read English meet these criteria!</p>
